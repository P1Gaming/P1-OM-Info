# Reviewing the exam

As a reviewer you want to make sure:
- That the person has cloned the project, not forked it.
- That you can access their branch without problems.
- That they have changed ONLY the list of names and nothing else.
- If the above requirements are met and the PR is merged, send the examee a message on Discord letting them know they are ready for apprenticeship.

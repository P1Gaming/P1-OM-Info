# Prototype used for marketing the game. Not the final game itself.

It is mainly used for:
- Testing experimental features.
- Join exams.
- Showcasing aspects of our game-idea.

As it is the Unity project that was created during the formation of this team it contains various problems:
- Contains a lot of old code from features that were scraped.
- Almost no documentation because originally people didn't give any importance to it.
- Lots of low quality code either due:
	- Prefering quick tests of features.
	- No code reviews ever.
	
This is not uncommon, many teams create "Quick and dirty" prototypes to test their ideas before creating the final product.

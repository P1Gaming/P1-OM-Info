# HOW TO

## Set up Unity and GitHub

Follow our guides [HERE](./unity.md) this one will give you our unity version, and [HERE](./GitHub.md) for learning about source control.

## Structure your code

Style guides are used so programming teams can have common standards and naming conventions for their code.
This helps code readability as in large projects you will be working with other peoples' code.
While it may be hard to start using different rules to what you're used to in the long run it helps the project be more accesible to newer members. 
See our Style Guide [HERE](./Style_Guide.md)

## Document your Code

Right below the using statements on the script add the below XML tag:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Code explanation here
/// </summary>
```

The explanation should follow these rule:
- Use it to explain WHAT the code does, what purpose the code fulfills.
- Make the explanation short, no more than 5 lines.
- Saying that the Jelly_sleep.cs "Handles the Jelly's sleep" is not an explanation.
- A good explanation should contain where this script should be attached or when it's functions are called.

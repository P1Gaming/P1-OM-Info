# Unity

To create our game we use Unity (you already know that).
Specifiacally:

For the Compassion Prototype we use Unity verions 2020.3.37f1 (You didn't know that).
If you don't have it you can download it *[HERE](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2020.3.37)*. 
Don't use other versions, yes I know 20203.34f1 is 99% the same, it cause problems.

The video below has detailed instructions if you need them.

For the full production game we use Unity version 2021.3.20f1 (You also didn't know that).
If you don't have it you can download it *[HERE](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.20)*. 

# Prefabs and the develop scene <img src="../images/prefab_icon.png" width="35" height="35">

The develop scene is the main scene we use and is compromised of multiple prefabricated objects (prefabs for short).
They have a blue color in the hierarchy.

![Hierarchy](../images/hierarchy.png)

When making changes to a prefab you need to find the object in the project files or open it from the inspector and do the changes there, <span style="color:yellow"> **not in the develop scene directly** </span>.
If the prefab contains other prefabs inside it, keep opening them.
